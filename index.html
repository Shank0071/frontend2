      <p style="color: hsl(0, 0%, 81%);">‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a 
      transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
      for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
      The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
      the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>
